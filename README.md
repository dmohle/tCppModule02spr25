Code up these three programs and submit your source code (funWithFunctions.cpp, largestOfThree.cpp, and reversedStrings.cpp) to your remote repo in GitHub Classroom.

1) reversedStrings.cpp - You will create a simple program that takes a user's input string and reverses it. For example, if the user inputs "hello", the program will output "olleh".

2) funWithFunctions.cpp -  You will explore the use of functions in C++. You will create a program that involves three distinct functions: getAnIntFromTheUser, compareTwoInts, and sumTwoInts. The program will demonstrate how functions can be used to break down a problem into smaller, manageable parts.

3) largestOfThree.cpp - This program, titled "largestOfThree.cpp," is designed to help you understand conditional statements in C++. Your task is to write a program that asks the user for three integers, determines the largest among them using nested if statements, and outputs the largest integer.
